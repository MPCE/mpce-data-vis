# MPCE: Data Visualisation

The *Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment* project has ammassed gigabytes of publishing data, from sales, publishing, and censorship records of eighteenth century France. There are canonical references for all places, people, books and editions in the data.

This repo contains our code-in-progress for exploratory visualisation of our publishing data.
